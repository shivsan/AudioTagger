# AudioTagger
Helps decode voices in an audio file, so that they can be tagged. Tagged voices can be programmatically retrieved like objects.

The idea of the project is to be able to identify voices in an audio file, from a meeting conversation.

After a voice is identified, the software should be able to pull up all instances of the voice.

Tag the voice.

Use cases:
1.) Create a timeline where user can visually identify the voice's contribution.

2.) Ability to pull up all instances of text speech where voice is heard.

3.) Filter by one of the voices alone.

4.) Something like in this paper, although this is sentiment analysis:
